- why is this the description for a lot of apps updates
	- nothing really happen, nothing valuable for the target group
	- there is no roadmap or future investment in the app
	- pretty stable and no intentions to change that
	- just fixing bugs
	- nothing relevant to inform
	- nobody reads it
	- it's an automated process
	- time involved in writing a detailed description
	- there is a notification mechanism inside the app to inform the user
