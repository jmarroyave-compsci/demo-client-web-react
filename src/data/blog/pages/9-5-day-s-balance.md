- What makes a good day at work?
	- what are you satisfied about?
	- what about the difficulties?, how fast the work has done?, many or few complications?, not knowing how to do it or just code what you know?

- What about the post "good day" day?
	- was as good as the the last one?
	- better or worse?

- Consistency
	- How bad or good are the days in average?
	- what's the minimun achievement of a bad day? what's the worse case scenario?

- Metrics
	- It's a bad or a good day a reliable metric?
	- How many days in a row have to be good or bad to be taken in account?
	- what about the subjectivity aspect of a "good day"?
	- would it be considered degrees between bad-good, like worst-best or normal and outstanding?
