6-4
- don't over complicate things, complexity will come
- the cycle of complications, the simplification, complexity and start over again and again
- is it not clear?, start and then figure it out?

7-4
- the unclear way to do something
- the imaginary expectative

7-5
- what the meaning of simplicity?

8-3
- the complexity of a project vrs the complexity of the implementation
- the buggy project, it's complexity and chaotic state 

9-2
- I can tell that my [Sprint 1]'s best way of doing X it's way different from my [Sprint 9]'s' way, what changed?
	- knowledge, but which part?
		- the project perspective
		- expectatives
	- the complexity has been ordered, it's still complex but it's more clear, I know and understand better the relations among the components
